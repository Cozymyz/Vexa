Methods for Expressing External Data in Vue Components and Strategies for Dividing Vuex Modules

Vexa is a YAML‑based, declarative architecture description language for the Vue ecosystem, specifically designed to define state management architectures and component data dependencies in Vue applications. Its core value lies in transforming traditional imperative architecture control logic (such as Vuex module partitioning and component data mapping) into versionable, statically analyzable, and automatically compilable configuration specifications—an innovative frontend realization of the “Configuration‑as‑Architecture” paradigm.
